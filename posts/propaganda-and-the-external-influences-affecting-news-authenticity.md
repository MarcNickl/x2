When looking at news coverage of a situation, from either a large establishment or individual broadcasters, 'propaganda' is seldom what people imagine it to be. Never is it dictated down from an all-powerful entity. However, this does not mean that the story isn't gently nudged into a more favourable line.

This is either done by restricting future access where you would lose the 'privilege' to be exclusive or to have an early embargo.

Another way a story is altered is by restricting what you're able to report on by either creating a bigger story or by restricting access to certain locations or people. This is mostly done with military or law enforcement.

However, the most influential factor influencing a news story is the human factor. Which is something that is very much underappreciated. 
this can be anything from a lack of sleep to hunger or a deep personal conviction. By no means am I saying that is a fault in journalists however it is something to be aware of.  Most reporters try to maintain a sense of integrity and try to convey truthfully what they are reporting on.

But this does not negate the fact that news stories do have a bunch of small factors that often do influence the larger picture.

It's not always a big conspiracy. I don't think this will change until we get an AI news editor and even then, it will have its points of view.

So might as well not watch it if it's doomed from the start? - eh

p.s

if a powerful entity is trying to force through a certain narrative, you won't notice or realise it.
