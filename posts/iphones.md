A﻿fter recently switching to an iphone. the keyboard is stupid. side loading is limited to 3 apps.

T﻿HE KEYBOARD IS SOO STUPID. Yandex is the only useable one and there i need to give my enitre life to russia. if i dont give it full keyboard access. it keeps prompting me. fucking cunts. **GIVE ME A WORKING KEYBOARD.**

NeoFreeBird is cool. s o is a hacked instagram thing i found. i would like more. but cant have unless i pay £79 per year. which i dont want to.

**T﻿HERE ISNT A SINGLE GOOD 2048 GAME!**

t﻿he main complaint is that i cant make changes quicker because certificates cant be deactivated and expire every 7 days. so i want to change somthing i need to wait a FUCKING week.

\-﻿ this is a start. i shall try and make a fully thought out bit of writing but till then. grrrrr.
