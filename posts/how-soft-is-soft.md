I think there is a way of measuring the quality of light. As in the softness/fall off of the light. I would like to look into this further.

T﻿his doesnt seem to give me the answer i want.





I﻿ feel a better solution would be to have a range of meter readings as you move the lightmeter across an area. the light meter would measurer the all off of the shadow giving you a number. 



i﻿n a paractical sense i dont see a good use for this. but on the other hand i dont see a real use for light meters yet....
