Duh! Simple right! Well, kind but no.

To my understanding, there are two fundamental ways to get a black and while image from a bayor sensor. 

The first way is to desaturate the image 'mathematically', basically taking a colour image and removing the chroma.

The second way is to only process one channel from an RGB video signal. Sort of going backwards in the de-bayor process.

Both of these methods do have a different effect.

Over time i will add some test images below for reference.
