# Goals

- T﻿ake money away from WIX, Squarespace and other extortionately expensive services.

# Fundamentals

## Can’s and cant’s

The main reason it is cheap is that it’s a static website. This means that it is basically an interactive PowerPoint presentation. This makes it perfect as a portfolio piece or a blog. But little else like.

## Tools and services used

There are 4 key components going into this method:

- Bootstrap Studio or Blocs

- Github

- Netify

- cloudflare

### Bootstrap Studio or Blocs

Bootstrap studio or Blocs is where the website is designed and created

### Github

GitHub is where the code is stored and accessed as well as allowing to roll back code to a previous version if a mistake was made

### Netify

Netify is the service that distributes the code to the internet - it gives you 100GB per month for free, which should be more than enough.

### CloudFlare

Finaly CloudFlare is the cheapest place i’ve found to buy a domain for around 9.77 US$/year.
