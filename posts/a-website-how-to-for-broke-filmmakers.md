# Goals

* T﻿ake money away from WIX, Squarespace and other extortionately expensive services.
* A desire to get people to build stuff.

# Fundamentals

## Can’s and cant’s

The main reason it is cheap is that it’s a static website. This means that it is basically an interactive PowerPoint presentation. This makes it perfect as a portfolio piece or a blog. But little else like.

## Tools and services used

There are 4 key components going into this method:

* Bootstrap Studio, Blocs or Webstudio
* Github
* Netify
* Cloudflare

### The Website Builder

This is where the website is designed and then exported for upload to GitHub.

Can be interchanged with any tool (preferably offline) that can export a static website.

The tools I would recommend are:

* Bootstrap Studio (Paid) (Windows and Mac)
* Blocs (Paid) (Mac)
* Webstudio (Free) (Windows and Mac)

All of these tools do NOT rely on a subscription model. And could in theory be available for free 😉

### Code Repository

GitHub is really the only contender here, although there are other available. This is where the code is stored and accessible to Netify. As well as allowing to roll back code to a previous version if a mistake was made.

### Content Delivery Network

Netify is the service that distributes the code to the internet - it gives you 100GB per month for free, which should be more than enough.

### Domain Registrar

Finally, CloudFlare is the cheapest place I’ve found to buy a domain for around 9.77 US$/year. I also feel they are the most straightforward when it comes to pricing without offering a year one discount, etc.

# How-To ish

I will try to explain the core concepts of getting a website online.

Because I have recommended 3 different website builders, I will be light on information focusing loosely on bootstrap as a framework, shared by blocs and bootstrap studio, this should hopefully cover the major elements. I will try to find a couple of decent YouTube channels and put them down below. - there is also google if you’re stuck :)

## Step 1 - Building a site and exporting it.

### Step 1.1 -  Website set up and themes

# Step 2 - Setting up a GitHub Repo and uploading

* Github Desktop

# Step 3 - Netify

* Setting up a project

# Step 4 - Domains

* DNS and linking to netify

# Tips and Tricks

* Use WebP
